## Description:

Hi
I created this tool to help with the mini-game of Haggling in Potion Craft.
This tool will automaticaly determine when to press the haggling button during the mini-game.

## Current State of the code:

I will keep this readme updated with the progression of the code.
This code is at: 
    - 0%
I am working on:
    - Code structure and initial organization,
    - Initial commit,
    - Learning.

## What this tool does:

In depth, this tool will do the following task:
    - Take screenshots of the game.
    - Determine if the haggling mini-game is present.
    - Start the mini-game.
    - Take screenshots very often of the mini-game.
    - Analyse screenshots to find zones and cursor position.
    - Move mouse cursor to the haggling button and press if the mini-game cursor is inside a zone.

Once haggling is done, It will go back to a slower paced mode where screenshots are taken less frequently.
It will resume automatically if it detect the haggling mini-game.

## Why:

This project was made with 2 specific purpose in mind:
1.  - Do the "Very Hard" mini-game in you stead.
    - Because why not? 
    - And the last mini-game is actually hard late at night which is when I play the most.

2.  - Teach me how to use python, 
    - Use external library,
    - Image analysis, 
    - Automation of task,
    - Keeping code documentation.

## What's my background:

I was an electrician, specialized in electrical repair.

**In coding?** Basically nothing.
I have learned by myself before but I wasn't dedicated in it in the past.
I learn most of my coding knowledge at my apprenticeship, like C#, HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of Java.
But nothing outisde basic understanding and application and small project for school.
My first actual experience is when I've learn lua for a ComputerCraft project.

**In IT?** I've learn plenty different subject:
    - How coding work,
    - How Windows work,
    - How linux work,
    - Installation of a wide variety of machine,
    - Custom PC build,
    - Customer support,
    - Custom install of OS depending on needs of client,
    - Networking,
    - Virtualization,
    - Video-conference

I also started to learn how **Reverse Engineering** work. (My beloved)
    - Learned how to reverse basic stuff,
    - Learned IDA and static analysis,
    - Started modding small game (Pokemon and Rom Hack of Pokemon),
    - Started doing crackmes (level 1),
    - Started looking for more challenging crackmes (level 2),
    - Started doing medium modding on game,
    - Learned WinDBG, cutter and x64dbg (stayed with x64dbg),
    - Learned dynamic analysis,
    - Learned Assembly (Yes, it took me this long before learning it),
    - Learned patching bynaries,
    - Learned bypass of functions,
    

I was an IT scientist apprentice.
Then I took an arrow in the knee.

## Description:

Hi,
I created this tool to help with the mini-game of Haggling in Potion Craft.
This tool will automaticaly determine when to press the haggling button during the mini-game.

## Current State of the code:

I will keep this readme updated with the progression of the code.

This code is at: 
+ 0%

I am working on:
+ Code structure and initial organization,
+ Initial commit,
+ Learning.

## What this tool does:

In depth, this tool will do the following task:
+ Take screenshots of the game.
+ Determine if the haggling mini-game is present.
+ Start the mini-game.
+ Take screenshots very often of the mini-game.
+ Analyse screenshots to find zones and cursor position.
+ Move mouse cursor to the haggling button and press if the mini-game cursor is inside a zone.


Once haggling is done, It will go back to a slower paced mode where screenshots are taken less frequently.
It will resume automatically if it detect the haggling mini-game.

## Why:

This project was made with 2 specific purpose in mind:
1.  - Do the "Very Hard" mini-game in your stead.
    - Because why not? 
    - And the last mini-game is actually hard late at night which is when I play the most.

2.  - Teach me how to use python, 
    - Use external library,
    - Image analysis, 
    - Automation of task,
    - Keeping code documentation.
